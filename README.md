# Library-management-system
The project was to make a stock system for a music shop. 
This project was done using C++. The framework catch2 was used for unit testing.

# Scenario:-
A library has found their book search system has become slower as their collection of books has grown. They need you to design an efficient program which allows searching for books by title and adding and removing books. The library has thousands of books (which is in the file "books").

- You will be provided with a sample of book data in a text file, which must be loaded by your program
- It should however, be possible for your program to load data from another file, e.g. by using a command line argument of the file name, to allow them to later load the full list of all books in the collection.
- add new books.
- remove books.
- search for a book.

# How to run

- Open the file on Command line/terminal.
- I have created a "Makefile" to compile the program. To run this "Makefile" simply type "make" in the command line/terminal.
- Then you can run the program by typeing the command "./library books".
- file "books" contains many books and the details. this file can be swaped with other files.
